            <p>The Russian alphabet may look daunting, but it is actually very easy to read and write. Below is a table
                with all the letters and how they are pronounced.</p>

            <h2 class="collapsible">Alphabet Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cursive Writing:</strong> Russian cursive is somewhat variable. You may often encounter upon
                    slightly differing variations of cursive handwriting. Generally, you can choose the style you
                    prefer, as long as it's legible for others.</li>
                <li><strong>Pronunciation of Unstressed Vowels:</strong> The vowels о and е are often pronounced as а
                    and и respectively when unstressed. However, they are still written as о and е. For example,
                    "хорошо" (good, fine, or OK) is romanized as "horosho" but is actually pronounced as "harasho."</li>
                <li><strong>Ш and Щ:</strong> These two consonants are not pronounced the same. Щ is sharper than ш, and
                    is pronounced similarly to the "sh" in "sheep." Meanwhile, ш is simply pronounced like the "sh" in
                    "shut."</li>
                <li><strong>Softened (Palatized) Consonants:</strong> Softening a consonant in Russian refers to
                    palatization. That is, modifying a consonant sound by moving the tongue closer to the hard palate
                    (the roof of the mouth). In this context, the consonant becomes "softer" because of this added "y"
                    sound quality. It's as if you're pronouncing the consonant while also trying to say a very slight
                    "y" sound simultaneously. For instance, when the consonant т is softened, it sounds more like the
                    "t" in "tune," while the regular т would sound more like the "t" in "top."</li>
                <li><strong>Rolling the Р:</strong> The Russian Р is rolled or trilled, unlike the English "R." Practice
                    trilling your tongue against the roof of your mouth to get the sound right.</li>
            </ul>
